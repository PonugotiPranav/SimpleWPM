Simple Typing Test for WPM
SimpleWPM is a minimalistic, browser-based application that randomly selects a quote for the user to type, in order to test their WPM (Words Per Minute).

Test it out here: https://ponugotipranav.github.io/SimpleWPM

Current Limitations:
- User must type out an exact match to the prompt for the test to conclude.
- Accuracy doesn't properly reflect overall # of mistakes, live WPM not displayed.

Future Ideas:
- Embed prompt within input field, and have color change from gray to black as user types out prompt.
- Will also allow for features like changing color of text to red when the user makes a mistake.
