Simple Typing Test for WPM
SimplyWPM is a minimalistic, browser-based application that randomly selects a quote for the user to type, in order to test their WPM (Words Per Minute).

Test it out here: https://ponugotipranav.github.io/SimplyWPM

Current Limitations:

User must type out an exact match to the prompt for the test to conclude.

Accuracy doesn't properly reflect overall # of mistakes, live WPM not displayed.

No strong visual indicator when mistakes are made (eg. highlighting wrong portions).

To-Do:
Embed prompt within input field, and have color change from gray to black as user types out prompt. This will also allow for features like changing color of text to red when the user makes a mistake.
